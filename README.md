# Unraid-Media-Server


I built an Unraid server using an HP Compaq 6005 Pro SFF, equipped with an AMD Athlon II x2 B24 3GHz CPU. Initially, the system had 4GB of RAM, which I later upgraded to 32GB. I also added two mismatched HDDs to increase storage capacity and removed the DVD drive, with plans to replace it with a 4-bay 2.5" SSD caddy.

Containers and Applications:

Plex: For media streaming and management.
Sonarr: Automating TV show downloads.
Radarr: Automating movie downloads.
Lidarr: Managing and downloading music.
Soulseek: For peer-to-peer file sharing.
SABnzbd & NZBGet: Usenet downloaders for handling automated media downloads.
This setup offers a comprehensive solution for managing and consuming my media collection, with automated tools ensuring everything stays organized and up to date. Future upgrades will enhance storage capacity and flexibility.
