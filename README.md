# Unraid-Media-Server


<h2>Unraid Media Server Setup</h2>

<p>I built an Unraid server using the following hardware:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Case:</strong> HP Compaq 6005 Pro SFF</li>
  <li><strong>CPU:</strong> AMD Athlon II x2 B24 3GHz</li>
  <li><strong>RAM:</strong> 32GB (upgraded from 4GB)</li>
  <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Two mismatched HDDs:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Disk 1:</strong> ST1000DM003-1CH162_S1DDWJ5V - 1 TB</li>
      <li><strong>Disk 2:</strong> WDC_WD1002FBYS-18W8B0 - 1 TB</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Planned Upgrade:</strong> 4-bay 2.5" SSD caddy (replacing the DVD drive)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Containers and Applications:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Plex</strong>: For media streaming and management.</li>
  <li><strong>Sonarr</strong>: Automating TV show downloads.</li>
  <li><strong>Radarr</strong>: Automating movie downloads.</li>
  <li><strong>Lidarr</strong>: Managing and downloading music.</li>
  <li><strong>Soulseek</strong>: For peer-to-peer file sharing.</li>
  <li><strong>SABnzbd & NZBGet</strong>: Usenet downloaders for handling automated media downloads.</li>
  <li><strong>Duplicatip</strong>: For secure cloud backup of important data.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Plugins:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Unassigned Devices</strong>: For managing drives not assigned to the array.</li>
  <li><strong>Unassigned Devices Preclear</strong>: For preclearing drives before adding them to the array.</li>
  <li><strong>Dynamix File Manager</strong>: For managing files and directories on the server.</li>
</ul>

<p>This setup offers a comprehensive solution for managing and consuming my media collection, with automated tools ensuring everything stays organized and up to date. Future upgrades will enhance storage capacity and flexibility.</p>
