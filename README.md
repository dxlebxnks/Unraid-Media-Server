# Unraid-Media-Server


<h2>Unraid Media Server Setup</h2>

<p>I built an Unraid server using an HP Compaq 6005 Pro SFF, equipped with an AMD Athlon II x2 B24 3GHz CPU. Initially, the system had 4GB of RAM, which I later upgraded to 32GB. I also added two mismatched HDDs to increase storage capacity and removed the DVD drive, with plans to replace it with a 4-bay 2.5" SSD caddy.</p>

<h3>Containers and Applications:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Plex</strong>: For media streaming and management.</li>
  <li><strong>Sonarr</strong>: Automating TV show downloads.</li>
  <li><strong>Radarr</strong>: Automating movie downloads.</li>
  <li><strong>Lidarr</strong>: Managing and downloading music.</li>
  <li><strong>Soulseek</strong>: For peer-to-peer file sharing.</li>
  <li><strong>SABnzbd & NZBGet</strong>: Usenet downloaders for handling automated media downloads.</li>
  <li><strong>Backblaze Personal Backup</strong>: For secure cloud backup of important data.</li>
</ul>

<p>This setup offers a comprehensive solution for managing and consuming my media collection, with automated tools ensuring everything stays organized and up to date. Future upgrades will enhance storage capacity and flexibility.</p>
